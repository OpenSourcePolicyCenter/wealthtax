Piketty Wealth Tax Paper
========================

A Brigham Young University Macroeconomics and Computational Laboratory project in conjunction with the Open Source Policy Center at the American Enterprise Institute.

Abstract
========
This project looks at the effects of both a wealth tax and an increase in the progressivity of the income tax on inequality in the context of an OLG model that is closely related to the dyanamic scoring model being developed by the BYUMCL and AEI's OSPC.  The repo includes data used in the calibration, and all the Python code necessary to solve and simulate the model.
